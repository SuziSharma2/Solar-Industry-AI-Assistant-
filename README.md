# Solar-Industry-AI-Assistant-
Solar Potential Analysis Tool
Overview
This AI-powered tool analyzes satellite imagery to assess rooftop solar installation potential, providing detailed recommendations and ROI estimates. Built with Streamlit, it simulates AI vision analysis and integrates solar industry knowledge.
Setup Instructions

Clone the Repository
git clone <https://github.com/SuziSharma2/Solar-Industry-AI-Assistant->
cd solar-analysis-tool


Install DependenciesEnsure Python 3.8+ is installed. Install required packages:
pip install streamlit pandas numpy


Run the ApplicationStart the Streamlit app:
streamlit run solar_analysis_app.py


Access the AppOpen your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8501.


Dependencies

Python 3.8+
streamlit==1.29.0
pandas==2.1.4
numpy==1.26.2

Example Usage

Launch the app.
Enter your location (e.g., "San Francisco, CA").
Upload a satellite image (PNG/JPG).
Specify electricity rate ($/kWh) and incentives ($).
Click "Analyze" to view results, including roof analysis, financial metrics, and recommendations.

Implementation Details

AI Integration: Uses a mock AI vision API to simulate rooftop analysis (area, shading, angle, solar potential). In production, integrate with OpenRouter or similar.
ROI Calculation: Estimates system size, costs, savings, and payback period based on industry-standard solar panel specs.
Error Handling: Robust logging and user-friendly error messages.
Data Storage: Saves analysis results as JSON files for record-keeping.
Interface: Streamlit-based web app with intuitive input forms and result displays.

Example Analyses

Input: Location: Austin, TX; Image: rooftop.jpg; Rate: $0.12/kWh; Incentives: $6000
Output: Roof Area: 1200 sqft, Shading: 15%, System Size: 9.6 kW, Total Cost: $10,080, Payback: 7.2 years

Future Improvements

Integrate real AI vision API (e.g., OpenRouter) for accurate image analysis.
Add support for multiple panel types and regional regulations.
Implement performance metrics (e.g., API response time, accuracy).
Deploy on Hugging Face Spaces for public access.
Add visualization for solar potential and shading maps.

Notes

The current implementation uses a mock AI vision API due to lack of access to real satellite imagery APIs.
Ensure compliance with local regulations for actual deployments.
